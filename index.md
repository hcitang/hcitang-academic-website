I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/) at the [University of Calgary](http://ucalgary.ca/). I direct the [RICELab (Rethinking Interaction, Collaboration and Engagement) research group](http://ricelab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/).

My current research explores the design, implementation and evaluation of novel systems for:
* mixed reality interfaces for collaboration
* electronic fashion as a means of expression
* remote immersion.

Broadly, I am interested in Human-Computer Interaction, and the sub-disciplines of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), and Ubiquitous Computing.

In my spare time, I enjoy cooking, watching cooking videos on YouTube, watching movies, and running after my kid.

In my previous life (i.e. before kiddo), I was an avid video game player, volleyball player (in real life), and aspired to be an awesome programmer.
