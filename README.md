# Tony Tang's academic website

Ripped shamelessly from Jordi Pont-Tuset's site (https://github.com/jponttuset/jponttuset.github.io)

Here's his readme:

This site is based on the **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)** theme, a two-column responsive Jekyll theme perfect for powering your GitHub hosted blog.


## License

Feel free to adapt this theme to your site without linking back to me or including a disclaimer, although letting me know would be nice. ;) 

## To run it locally
```
jekyll serve --watch --port 5000
```

## To load it up
```
bundle update
```
