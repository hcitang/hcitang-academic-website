title: Getting Access to Readings
---

Do not pay for academic papers, because if you are a student, your institution probably has subscriptions to the publisher. (And your institution has paid BIG BUCKS for the subscription.)

Three different ways to get access to papers:

1. Bookmarklet to your institution's subscription (see how to do this below for U of T)
2. [Set up Google Scholar to default to your institution's subscription](https://ricelab.github.io/blog/2015/google-scholar-howto/)
3. Email the lead author of the paper to ask for a pre-print

## Bookmarklet to access papers (UofT specific)

Add the following as a bookmarklet (for Chrome):

```
javascript:void(location.href='[http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?url=](http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?url=)'+location.href)
```

When you navigate to a page that needs a subscription (e.g. ACM DL, IEEE, Springer, etc.), just click the bookmarklet, login with your UCalgary credentials, and you'll be able to download any PDF that our university has a subscription for.

Thanks to Wes Willett for the original one for UCalgary, and then this page for the code for UofToronto: http://individual.utoronto.ca/hiltsand/myaccess.html
