Do not pay for academic papers, because if you are a student, your institution probably has subscriptions to the publisher. (And your institution has paid BIG BUCKS for the subscription.)


Add the following as a bookmarklet (for Chrome):

```
javascript:void(location.href='[http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?url=](http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?url=)'+location.href)
```

When you navigate to a page that needs a subscription (e.g. ACM DL, IEEE, Springer, etc.), just click the bookmarklet, login with your UCalgary credentials, and you'll be able to download any PDF that our university has a subscription for.

Thanks to Wes Willett for the original one for UCalgary, and then this page for the code for UofToronto: http://individual.utoronto.ca/hiltsand/myaccess.html
