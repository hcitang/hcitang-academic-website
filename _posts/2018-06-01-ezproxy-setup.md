Add the following as a bookmarklet (for Chrome):

```
javascript:void(location.href='[http://ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/login?url=](http://ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/login?url=)'+location.href)
```

When you navigate to a page that needs a subscription (e.g. ACM DL, IEEE, Springer, etc.), just click the bookmarklet, login with your UCalgary credentials, and you'll be able to download any PDF that our university has a subscription for.
