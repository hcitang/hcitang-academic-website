## Welcome to the Official HCITangs Club Webpage!

If your last name is Tang, you're involved in the HCI community somehow, and you would like to be part of the club, just let one of us know, and you can be part of the club.

We don't do much except for take goofy photos at CHI and occasionally go out for food.

* [John C Tang](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/johntang/) - Eldest of the HCI Tangs

* [Charlotte Tang](https://charlottetang.ca/)
* [Karen P Tang](http://www.kptang.com/)
* [Tony Tang]({{site.baseurl}}) - Yours truly!

### Fun Facts

* For most of us, our last name rhymes with "gang" (and we _are_ a gang!).  John is special, and his name rhymes with "long."  It turns out that his name is actually written as "soup" in Chinese.
